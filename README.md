Axum-based webserver based on [rustdb](https://github.com/georgebarwood/RustDB) database, with database browsing, password hashing, database replication, email tranmission and timed jobs.

Installation and starting server
================================
Change to the directory where the database is to be stored ( it will be named rustweb.rustdb ). 

Install Rust, then run cargo commands

cargo install rustweb

cargo run rustweb 3000

This should start rustweb server, listening on port 3000.

You should then be able to browse to http://localhost:3000/Menu

From there are links to a Manual, Execute SQL, a list of Schemas and other links.

Security
========

Initially login security is disabled. To enable it 

(1) Edit the function login.hash and change the salt string.

(2) Create a record in login.user.

(3) Use the Logins link to set up a password.

(4) Edit the function login.get ( see instructions included there ).

Database replication
====================

Start Rustweb in the directory (folder) where you want the replicated database stored, specifying the  -rep option

For example:

rustweb --rep https://mydomain.com

If login security has been enabled, you will need to specify login details ( obtained from the login.user table ), for example:

--login "uid=1; hpw=0xaaa023850abbdff839894888dd8e8abbceaaa023855abbdff839894888dd8e8c"

If the database is very large, it may be more practical to use FTP to get an initial copy of the database, otherwise a copy will be fetched automatically.

Replication is enabled by records being inserted in the log.Transaction table. 

These records can be periodically deleted, provided that all replication servers are up to date.

Email
=====

Email can be sent using the email schema.

(1) Ceate a record in email.SmtpServer

(2) Create an email in email.msg

(3) Insert it into email.Queue

(4) Call the builtin function EMAILTX()

If an email cannot be sent, and the error is temporary, it will be inserted into the email.Delayed table and retried later.

Permanent errors are logged in email.SendError

Timed Jobs
==========

A named SQL function (with no parameters) can be called at a specified time by creating a record in timed.Job.

This is used by the email system to retry temporary email send errors.
